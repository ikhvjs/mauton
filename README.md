## Getting Started 🚀

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites 📋

You'll need:
* [Git](https://git-scm.com) 
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [NPM](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer.
* [Google reCAPTCHA v3](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/v3) (which you need to register for a key)
* [A Mauton API](https://github.com/ikhvjs/mauton-api) (which is for the Backend)

```
node@v10.16.0 or higher
npm@6.9.0 or higher

```

**NOTE**:
When you register your reCAPTCHA Key, remember to set domain for your reCAPTCHA same as your frontend in the google reCAPTCHA website.

Then you can install the dependencies either using NPM:

Using NPM:
